Once it's done, you can use this repo to create, modify, and query your own databases. My version of SQL written with Python.

Whoops now it's a wordle program. That went off the rails! Don't you hate it when you don't finish where you thought you would?

To use:

1. Ignore all the files I deleted, they don't concern you
2. Clone and cd into the repo
3. Type python3 wordle.py followed by the words you want to guess into the command line (for example, python3 wordle.py steer stove swipe). The answer is randomly picked from the list of words that was used in the original Wordle.
4. You will see which letters are yellow, which letters are green, and how many possible words from the original wordle list are still possible answers
