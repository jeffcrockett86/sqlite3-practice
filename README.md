Once it's done, you can use this repo to create, modify, and query your own databases. My version of SQL written with Python.

Whoops now it's a wordle program. That went off the rails! Don't you hate it when you don't finish where you thought you would?

To use:

1. Ignore all the files I deleted, they don't concern you
2. Clone and cd into the repo
3. Type python3 wordle.py followed by the words you want to guess into the command line (for example, python wordle.py steer stove swipe)
4. It will show you how many guesses you have left
